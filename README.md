# 🌾☁️ AgriWeather Alert System

## 📌 Project Description

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Many farmers, especially in rural areas, are not comfortable using smartphones or typing queries online. However, they can read messages and make phone calls. They often rely on rumors or second-hand weather advice, which sometimes leads to uninformed crop decisions.

---

### 📊 _According to the _Down To Earth: State of India’s Environment in Figures 2020_ report:_

#### 🌾 More than 50% of marginal farmers reported losing crops due to unseasonal rains, floods, or heatwaves

#### 📡 **There’s a gap in weather communication**, especially for farmers without smartphones or internet access.

### 🔍 Evidence from Report

### ✅ Solution Overview

AgriWeather Alert System automates the delivery of weather updates via SMS, WhatsApp, and voice calls in Hindi and
English, requiring no technical skills or interactions from the farmers. It runs scheduled weather checks twice a day
and sends easy-to-understand messages or provides weather information through voice calls.

### 🌾 Key Benefits

1. **No smartphone or internet required for voice calls** — farmers can simply dial a number from any basic phone and
   speak their city name to get weather updates in their language.

2. **Fully supports non-tech-savvy users** — especially useful for farmers who cannot operate apps or browse the
   internet.
3. **Multiple channels available:**

    * 📞 **Voice Call (no internet or smartphone needed)**
    * 📩**SMS & WhatsApp (requires a phone with basic or smart messaging capability)**

4. **Language preference** — farmers choose Hindi or English at the start of the call, and all updates follow in that
   language.

5. **Natural interaction** — speak the city name in your voice; no need to type or navigate menus.

6. **Daily updates automatically** — once a location is set as primary, updates are sent every day without having to
   call or message again.

7. Saves time and effort — no need to wait for newspapers or depend on others for weather info.

8. Accurate and reliable — based on real-time weather data and summarized in a farmer-friendly format.
